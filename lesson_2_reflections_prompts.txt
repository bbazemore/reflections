What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	The git infrastructure with hidden files is set up. No files are committed, the log is empty.
	You need to init git so it will be prepared to commit files / changes.
	
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?
	The working directory contains all files. The staging directory contains the files that will
	be added to the repository.  This allows you to screen out temporary working files from the commit.
