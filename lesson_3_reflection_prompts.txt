When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    There are several reasons to keep your work remote. If you are working from several devices,
    or have several people contributing, it is easier to keep the content in sync in the cloud / remote.
    If your local repository is spotty, such as having a failing disk, storing content remote is a good back up.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    If you are in the middle of coding something, you might not want to have to
	merge other changes until you are at a good stopping point to integrate them.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Use a Fork if you want to give credit to the original author / repository on github.
	Clone if you want a one way link / no credit given to the original.
	Use a branch if you want to extend the original in the original repository.
