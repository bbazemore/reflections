When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    There are several reasons to keep your work remote. If you are working from several devices,
    or have several people contributing, it is easier to keep the content in sync in the cloud / remote.
    If your local repository is spotty, such as having a failing disk, storing content remote is a good back up.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    If you are in the middle of coding something, you might not want to have to
	merge other changes until you are at a good stopping point to integrate them.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Use a Fork if you want to give credit to the original author / repository on github.
	Clone if you want a one way link / no credit given to the original.
	Use a branch if you want to extend the original in the original repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    Having a local copy of the remote allows you to merge changes offline.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    You could collaborate using a different change management tool such as svn, or by
	emailing each other changes.  GitHub or other formal change management tool are
	easier in the long run, especially if there are branches.  Email is easier if there
	are only one or two changes total.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
